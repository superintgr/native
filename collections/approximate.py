"""Policy
(1) `master` is an undirected graph object which should be seen as network substrate.
(2) new information is processed by the master node where it compiles the data into 2 dimensional object code.
(3) for information to be new there has to be distinguishable features of the data that constitute extending the population size accordingly.
(4) if information can be present in a state of an object, then that object must have at least two distinguishable states where their attributes can encode information.
(5) if information can be encoded in a pair of states of two objects that each have necessary properties for storing the data, then the two can carry out processing of information too.
(6) if two objects that can process information have unity, then the union of the two states cannot hold information.
