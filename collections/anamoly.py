It is a type of module defined over the space of named objects whose composite objects yields an integer.

integers are defined as they are usual mathematical properties but there are special class of integers whose definitions conform the mainstream theory and those stream types are called **superintegers**.

$\mathbb{Z}_{0}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_{1}$ _compose_ a **supernative** $\mathcal{S}_{N}$ whose repertoire contains the set of all pairs ${\{(-1, -0), \dots, (0+, 1+)}\}$ whose transformation produces ${\{(1-, 0-), \dots, (-0,-1)}\}$ and ${\{(+1, +0), \dots, (1-, 0-)}\}$ and finally ${\{(1+, 0+), \dots, (-0, -1)}\}$.

The set of all superintegers then constitute the basis $\mathbf{S}_{-0}{0-} \otimes \mathbf{S}_{-1}{1-}$
