    For two objects that are some distance apart, it feels like their distance could be reduced arbitrarily much without causing them to collide with each other.

    Suppose we embed all of what is there into a place containing the whole identity bases of some problem object.
    If there is some solution from the state of the problem identity to analogous identity where the two could be composed such that a complete picture could be constructed where both problem-solution images are contained in that picture.

    Place the two objects along a number line, ranging between (0, 1).

    Whenever the solution isn't incorporated into the states of the problem object, their distance is guranteed to be not 0. For a distance close to 0, the picture may include the necessary information so that a viewer could cause them to overlap and annhilate each other.
    Whenever the solution-problem both incorporate each others images, the degree to what elements overlap and transfer locality information determine how far into the problem constituting system is able to explain the picture as limiting case of a larger picture.

    If the distance could be varied at all then every change contributing the variability translates into the picture containing the two becoming accessible or inaccessible. Other labeling could be soluble or insoluble.

    If there is a way to define something, one of them has to give names to all the elementary distances in terms of their image contributions.

    Other ways would describe various non-linear paths that constitute various distances being covered and how their associated images add upto the final picture.

    Considering the set of integers, any two integers could correspond to different fixed distances being covered, therefore a way to name the associated images.
    If each integer valued distances constitute a unit solution being discovered then the entire picture would contain all of the ways solutions and problems could emerge/reduce/swap/converge/limit each others images.
    Whether the series of integer valued positions reduces problem into soluble tasks or makes the problem harder through insoluble tasks depend on the space between each interval along the series.

    There are infinitely many real numbers between any two intervals and all states that covers the entire distance or gets stuck within the same interval takes their forms over these transitionary zones.
