    For two objects that are some distance apart, it feels like their distance could be reduced arbitrarily much without causing them to collide with each other.

    Suppose we embed all of what is there into a place containing the whole identity bases of some problem object.
    If there is some solution from the state of the problem identity to analogous identity where the two could be composed such that a complete picture could be constructed where both problem-solution images are contained in that picture.

    Place the two objects along a number line, ranging between (0, 1).

    Whenever the solution isn't incorporated into the states of the problem object, their distance is guranteed to be not 0. For a distance close to 0, the picture may include the necessary information so that a viewer could cause them to overlap and annhilate each other.
    Whenever the solution-problem both incorporate each others images, the degree to what elements overlap and transfer locality information determine how far into the problem constituting system is able to explain the picture as limiting case of a larger picture.

    If the distance could be varied at all then every change contributing the variability translates into the picture containing the two becoming accessible or inaccessible. Other labeling could be soluble or insoluble.

    If there is a way to define something, one of them has to give names to all the elementary distances in terms of their image contributions.

    Other ways would describe various non-linear paths that constitute various distances being covered and how their associated images add upto the final picture.

    Considering the set of integers, any two integers could correspond to different fixed distances being covered, therefore a way to name the associated images.
    If each integer valued distances constitute a unit solution being discovered then the entire picture would contain all of the ways solutions and problems could emerge/reduce/swap/converge/limit each others images.
    Whether the series of integer valued positions reduces problem into soluble tasks or makes the problem harder through insoluble tasks depend on the space between each interval along the series.

    There are infinitely many real numbers between any two intervals and all states that covers the entire distance or gets stuck within the same interval takes their forms over these transitionary zones.

    Problem must be defining its properties in expectation of those properties start composing associated attributes to cause soluble properties to be found.
    Solution would have to be a disjoint problem object that composes its attributes to constitute a discoverable form through which the two exchanges knowledge via differentiating each others objective forms.

    We could assert the following principle:
    .. if we have two columns of binary values where each of them carries the opposite state of the other:
    .... we can setup a logical resolution independently for each of the channels own reading of the binary amplitude.

    When inside one substrate there is a binary 1 along a row, a process could be triggered on the condition [1, 0]. Similarly the other substrate could use [0, 1] in its own channel.

    Now if each of the channels encode their process states to construct a third state then [1, 0, 0] and [0, 1, 0] would constitute a valid process where [1, 0, 0] -> [0, 1, 0] -> [0, 0, 1] -> [0, 1, 0] -> [1, 0, 0]
