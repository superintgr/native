# learned, as it couldn't be.

# reduction of code: i will squeeze and capture all of the necessary requirements in
# explicit code form into a over-all bundle for any other future requirements.
# these code modules will capture the following:
.. pytorch: model builder api (sequential, module, embedding, linear, rnn, lstm)
.. pytorch: model presets (transformer**)
.. pytorch: model utils api (save, load, torchaudio, rand, ones, zeros, empty)
.. pytorch: model training (optimizer api, criterion api, training loop generator, testing generator, checkpoint creator)

.. docker tools
