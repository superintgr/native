**society of minds**

. brief overview:
    1. structure captures minimal system construction requirements.
    2. program compiled on the standard basis would enable artificial curiosity.
    3. artificial refers only to fact that biological substrate is not what it assumes.
    4. a closed set of computation variables cover their respective fields completely.
    5. completeness will refer to the quality of a subsystem whereby it enables universal
       computability of all component systems with logically realizable persistence in
       every conservative recording of object existence along with many other instruments.
    6. any personality characteristics must yield the fullest universality in supporting
       all associated instances of computation where information medium is required exclusively.
    7. two kinds of memory causes the substrate to get around all involvement of its own
       computational basis states, such that when locally accessible information is blocked
       at one phase of the process, the other will keep the above set of conditions true.
