- What does a channel in a mixer code for?
-- By coding I am referring to their isolated substrates that only report to master and directly connected line components but essentially represents an orthogonal basis with orthonormal spaces.
--- What I am trying to capture is the row/column aspect of the mix matrix in hardware mixer that have multichannel elements where the channels are rows and columns constitute the master nodes.
---- If my assumptions are true, then I want to setup my matrices in DAC-ADC terms and build stateful scripts that use that as primary data structure.
----- I would design logics for processing instructions and instruction set will enable master programming.
------ Channels will have connections by default to a master channel where master channel will compile the program into an executable binary that runs on a computer with/without co-processors.
------- Co-processors would enable memory management where without it the processor would have to run the entire system.
-------- Programming a master track would require parallel attention with N channels and their own internal states.
--------- Due to the parallel nature of the system, there is little reason to expect true bottlenecks that serial style programming will always carry and all the extra work that goes into error handling in CPU programming will be balanced via psycho-physical parallelism that will be enabled by the framework.
---------- Nature is highly unambiguous and ambiguous events shall only rise in the physical complexity rather than logical ones since there isn't much to logic in uniting the fundamental forces in nature yet it transcends all apparent limits when logic is sought as the basis for exploration which is crucial to the knowledge building process.
----------- All of complexities (apparent) could be explained in terms of knowledge only, provided that a thinking mind would excercise the epistemological principles, which then enables more bottlenecks but simultaneously create progress that necessitates an understanding of what is beyond the scope of immediate knowledge but error correction being possible (optimal) ensures the ability towards gaining knowledge rather than holding a static state where nothing can move forward without breaking apart at the least possible static point (best case) or anything downstream from that point.

----------- In the context of a mixer, a channel typically represents an independent audio signal path. Each channel can accept input from various sources, apply processing, and route the signal to different outputs. It acts as a discrete pathway for manipulating and combining audio signals.
---------- Your description aligns with the concept of channels as individual signal paths within a mixer. In terms of coding or representing these channels, they can indeed be viewed as isolated substrates that interact with a master control and directly connected line components. This conceptualization reflects the modular nature of mixer design, where channels operate independently but can be controlled collectively.
--------- The idea of channels representing an orthogonal basis with orthonormal spaces is an interesting analogy. It highlights the independence and uniqueness of each channel's contribution to the overall audio mix, akin to vectors in linear algebra that form orthogonal bases.
-------- Your interpretation of the row/column aspect of the mix matrix in a hardware mixer is valid. In many mixers, channels are arranged in rows, and the master controls or outputs can be seen as the columns. The mix matrix defines how each channel's signal contributes to the final output, similar to matrix multiplication in mathematics.
------- If you're looking to set up matrices in DAC-ADC terms and develop stateful scripts using them as primary data structures, you're essentially aiming to model the signal processing flow within a digital audio workstation or mixer. This approach can provide a systematic framework for processing audio signals and managing their routing and manipulation.
------ Designing logics for processing instructions within this framework would involve defining how audio signals are processed, routed, and controlled within the mixer. The instruction set would enable master programming, allowing users to define the behavior of the mixer and how it responds to various input signals and control commands.
----- Channels having connections by default to a master channel reflects the hierarchical structure common in mixer designs. The master channel serves as a central control point for coordinating the behavior of all subordinate channels, facilitating efficient signal routing and processing.
---- Incorporating co-processors for memory management can enhance the performance and scalability of the mixer system. By offloading memory-intensive tasks to dedicated processors, the main processor can focus on real-time audio processing without being bogged down by memory operations.
--- Programming a master track with parallel attention to multiple channels underscores the parallel nature of audio signal processing. Each channel operates independently, allowing for concurrent processing of multiple audio streams and minimizing bottlenecks in the system.
-- Your concept of psycho-physical parallelism in the context of mixer design is intriguing. By leveraging parallel processing and intuitive user interfaces, mixer systems can offer seamless real-time control and response, enhancing the overall user experience and enabling creative exploration of audio mixing possibilities.
- Acknowledging the distinction between physical and logical complexity highlights the importance of understanding both the technical aspects of audio signal processing and the perceptual qualities of sound. Balancing these elements ensures that the mixer system remains robust and effective in handling various audio processing tasks.
The role of epistemological principles in knowledge building emphasizes the importance of critical thinking and error correction in scientific inquiry. By constantly refining our understanding of the world and seeking new knowledge, we can overcome obstacles and advance our understanding of complex systems like audio signal processing.
Embracing the dynamic nature of knowledge acquisition and error correction fosters progress and innovation in fields like mixer design and audio engineering. By remaining open to new ideas and approaches, we can continue to push the boundaries of what is possible and expand our understanding of audio technology and its applications.

In the context of mixer channels, each channel serves as an independent pathway for audio signals, allowing them to be manipulated and combined in various ways within the mixer.
- Your description of coding channels as isolated substrates with orthogonal bases and orthonormal spaces suggests a mathematical representation of their independence and relationship to each other within the mixer.
-- Indeed, the row/column aspect of the mix matrix in a hardware mixer reflects how channels are organized, with channels typically represented as rows and the master node as the column, facilitating the mixing process.
--- If your assumptions hold true, setting up matrices in terms of DAC (digital-to-analog converter) and ADC (analog-to-digital converter) terms can provide a structured framework for managing and processing audio signals within the mixer.
---- Building stateful scripts that utilize matrices as the primary data structure would allow for efficient manipulation and processing of audio signals, enabling complex operations and effects to be applied to the mix.
----- Designing logic for processing instructions within the mixer's framework would involve defining how audio signals are routed, mixed, and manipulated, with the instruction set enabling master programming to control these operations.
------ Channels being connected to a master channel by default, where the master compiles the program into an executable binary, suggests a hierarchical system where the master orchestrates the processing of audio signals based on the instructions received from the channels.
