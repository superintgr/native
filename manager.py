catalog the resource attribute that are usable for transformation tasks
a transformation task would be in terms of a state of static object with known properties whose attributes are reshaped by the constructor thus turning the object attributes into another variable attributes whose properties satisfy the task description.


generic attributes are used for the properties of those values along with a matrix into a system of equations.

this system of linear equations contains the variable whose properties are determined by the convergent into the target state from their generic counterpart.

this constitutes a substrate with its own resource matrix which could be used for arbitrary functions up to the level that is physically possible.


creating a reversible computation task for transforming some generic source into a usable (possible) substrate attributes.

this task is a permutation over the set of at least two parameters defining the substrate attribute.

computing function (C[pi]) over [S] is the union of all x -> pi(x) where x is a possible valid attribute in S.

def compute(permutator, source):
    for x in source:
        y = permutator(x)
        yield union(x, y)
