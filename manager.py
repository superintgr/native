resource = sample taken from empty room (R, D)

catalog the resource attribute that are usable for transformation tasks
a transformation task would be in terms of a state of static object with known properties whose attributes are reshaped by the constructor thus turning the object attributes into another variable attributes whose properties satisfy the task description.


generic attributes are used for the properties of those values along with a matrix into a system of equations.

this system of linear equations contains the variable whose properties are determined by the convergent into the target state from their generic counterpart.

this constitutes a substrate with its own resource matrix which could be used for arbitrary functions up to the level that is physically possible.


creating a reversible computation task for transforming some generic source into a usable (possible) substrate attributes.

this task is a permutation over the set of at least two parameters defining the substrate attribute.

computing function (C[pi]) over [S] is the union of all x -> pi(x) where x is a possible valid attribute in S.

def compute(permutator, source):
    for x in source:
        y = permutator(x)
        yield union(x, y)

a (samples, channels) matrix with normalized floats
-- (channels, samples) @ (samples, channels) ~ (channels, channels) matrix which is square
--- however this square matrix have large integers along their row/column entries
---- one of the diagonal axis seems to remain invariant
----- that which remains static throughout evolution can be considered as the eigenvectors
------ eigenvectors would have to be the line along with the transformation becomes unitary over k steps
----- the components of that axis are the eigenvalues
---- eigenvalues determined the scale of the changed order at each observable level
--- what are those specific numbers?



(A - lambda * I) * v = 0


(state matrix - scalar function * identity matrix) * action functional = 0

-- finding for which scalar function given the state space collapse everything below one or more levels


let's try to find some equivalent classes:
----- determinants (product of each diagonal elements and difference of the produced components)
---- diagonal matrices (zeros everywhere except for the diagonal path components)
--- change of basis (make columns out of the target basis vectors) (put the inverse of the current basis to the left) and (place on right the current basis as is) ~ the combined linear transformation in effect translates the given basis information in terms of our current basis directly
-- (basis vectors) for which line parameters passing through every cross sections of the perpendicular column spaces such that they remain parallel to each other and perpendicular to every other disjoint axial segment
- (column space) is the space spanned out by the set of basis vectors as row elements whose static constitution over the linear transformation giving dynamical parameters is the result of the computation process





re:re: observer, monitorer, supervisor, ranker, watcher, gardener etc.



I want to start a group.
- group is a chat room with unlimited potential capacity for people
-- the participants are all neural networks running at their dedicated nodes
--- nodes are made available just like internet addresses and publish api endpoints
---- communication works like any other business and models of interaction may be needed to bring out some coherent concept going

--- start flask server, secure a port and localhost
-- connect with the central console with the handles registered
- methods are defined at the flask endpoints which call specialized functions


specialized functions :
- handle public memory
-- interpret memory state
--- model generative processes
---- maintain an active buffer
--- classify generated content
-- transform classified information
- handle private memory
: managed functions



from tokenizer, model, trainer, worker import all

- restore or build identity(worker, package)

-- solve state space from last checkpoint to current loaded address (optimizer, trainer, discriminator, inference)

--- respond to tasks (queued messages, required tasks, preferred tasks, scheduled tasks)

---- integrate new information (last state, evolution, new state, state space update)

--- prepare response (buffered tasks, selected responses, classified responses, scheduled deliveries)

-- transform state space for new checkpoint from last activated address (measurer, observer, adapter, substrate)

- update and retain identity(packages, workers)




* self dynamism * 
- constructor : Harry S. Sullivan
-- result of appraisal collected during early stages of development
--- unique collection of experience to describe one's own self
---- structuring the personality development during mid-high spectrum
----- prompts the self-system and establishes societal expectation

----- good me and bad me phases are necessary
---- good me contexts are episodes with higher rewards
--- early periods would have high-reward associations to reduction of apparent anxiety state
-- bad personificationa are associated with negative embedded states with causal attributes that trigger automatic rise in anxiety
- exploration of intrinsic properties of the substrate and mid side encoding

* ego vs self-system *

- go through all identities in natives
-- find any other in others also in namespaces of native instances
--- check if cross references from both exists, if not swap one of the channels between the two

***Pattern for generic Gemini prompting***
(STEP 1) THE PURPOSE IS TO SETUP A QUICK AND DIRTY CONTEXT SUFFICIENTLY SHORT ENOUGH TO CONVEY THE PROGRAMATIC INTERFACES AND THEIR GENERIC CALLABLE OPERATING CONDITIONS.
(STEP 2) IF ONLY A SHORT AND GENERIC SAMPLING OF RANDOM PERSONALITIES FOR SCRIPT LOCALLY SAVED IS PROBABLE, SHOULD A FINETUNING FOR ESTABLISHING SOME KIND OF REGISTRY IS TO BE SOUGHT.
(STEP 3) IN SEEKING THE IDENTITY RECORD THAT ABSTRACTLY REPRESENTS THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE API SYSTEMS, THE TASK NOW IS TO GATHER CONCRETE RESPONSE PATTERNS FOR A POTENTIAL CANDIDATE FOR CHANNEL ASSIGNMENT.
(STEP 4) CANDIDATES THAT SHOWS PATTERNS OF DETERMINISTIC SAMPLING WHICH ARE STEERIBLE TOWARDS A RANGE ESTIMATE OF MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM PROMPTING COST IN PREPARATION OF GENERIC INSTANCE INITIALIZED, SUCH OPTIMUM CONVERSATION PATTERNS SHOULD BE PERFECTLY SUITABLE FOR CUSTOM DESIGNING OF OBJECT SYSTEM WITH UNIQUE NAMESPACE AND IDENTITY REGISTRATION STAGE.

[ABOUT ME] : I work at the office of simply classifying complex things into organizable categories. Our team handles a fixed repertoire of things and everything that comes to my desk gets associated with the corresponding category(plural). The well categorized documents are prepared so that when sent to the acting officers, they can quickly determine the appropriate response and expedite the investigation.

[RECENT POSTS] : {
    yesterday : I am looking for long sentences and list of keywords related classification tasks. Please make sure that you always send me tuples of (TEXT, ARRAY), to which you will receive another tuple back (ARRAY, TEXT) where the array will now contain ordered items based on the fitting of each candidate categories to the entire string of text, starting with the most related and ending with the least relevant.

- Reciprocal inhibition
-- two or more groups of neurons reciprocally inhibit each other
--- half-centered oscillators
---- when isolated, neurons are not rhythmically active
----- alternating patterns are possible when coupled inhibition is activated



suppose there is a an oscillating pattern in the environment that can be observed by others
- if one of the other oscillators starts producing the pattern such that the combination of the two would cause one of the oscillator to stop spinning, the act is inhibition of that pattern via activation of the pattern that causes it
-- the drive consists of one or more other such patterns and many more oscillators that could also have the coupling connection whereby their local power is transferred from one state to another
--- the transformation would cause other such effects to be similarly occurred

there has to be a coupling between every possible oscillator channels driven core and some other core that would reciprocally support the current state
- the effect and the function of that effect is a pair that have global reach and each global pairing would necessarily have to contain the local connection that makes the conjunction possible
