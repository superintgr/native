# Different Levels

1. modeling patterns, encoding/decoding, embedding, parsing, vectorizing, read/write/update tasks, os communucations
2. connecting model outputs, conditioning on multipath propagation, closures and constructions, building modules and setting training schedules
3. preparing task managers, setting up construction modules, building models of work repository, pipelining constructions with tasks, externally handling optimization through task registry, supervising construction processes, building direct injection gateway and automatic integration pipeline
4. setting up complete end-to-end modeling, managing whole instances and their substrate support, online and offline communication protocols, resource optimization and linear programming
