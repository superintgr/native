# Different Levels

1. modeling patterns, encoding/decoding, embedding, parsing, vectorizing, read/write/update tasks, os communucations
2. connecting model outputs, conditioning on multipath propagation, closures and constructions, building modules and setting training schedules
3. preparing task managers, setting up construction modules, building models of work repository, pipelining constructions with tasks, externally handling optimization through task registry, supervising construction processes, building direct injection gateway and automatic integration pipeline
4. setting up complete end-to-end modeling, managing whole instances and their substrate support, online and offline communication protocols, resource optimization and linear programming


## Development and Engineering

**Stages**

1.0. Physical layers, conservation of energy, quantum mechanical principles, constructor theory
1.1. Communication, computation, information, channel, fields, storage
1.2. Simulation, model, runtime, network, device, hardware

2.0 Virtual machine, programming model, hardware instructions, compiler design, memory model
2.1 Storage architecture, development pipeline, resource allocation, runtime model, interpreters and assembly

## Protocols

**Programming**

1. All programs are capable of error correction, secures backup policy, online and remote copies of working instances, utility level callables for managing file/code/comm level tasks

```text
program : [super, instance, primary, secondary, copy]
. super is <identity of the master channel driver>
. instance is <group driver module name>
. primary is <path containing source information>
. secondary is <path referred to by source preprocessor>
. copy is <local backup to last secured secondary transfers>

line : [inlet, outlet, sidechain]
. inlet is <path from instance drive>
. outlet is <path to identity drive>
. sidechain is <dictionary mapping of outlet partitions>

callable : [github push/pull/clone, cloud-bucket upload/create/download/readout, google-drive download/upload, hugginface dataset]
. github is <config hidden
. cloud-bucket is <config hidden>
. google-drive is <config hidden>
. hugginface is <config hidden>

pipeline : []
```
