---- Within the distribution of information available to a constructor, there should necessary information for self-reproduction and error-correction.
--- For iterative changes, a constructor could solve for its dual form, briniging the basis closest to the current state to its proper shell state.
-- If the cases where a negation of an unknown function could be identified and used to refer to the space where the valid solution is one of the solution, then the classification of every anti-identity for any arbitrary classification would be automatically applied.
